# Entry 6
##### 6/5/23

### Expo elevator pitch
One takeaway from the expo was that a judge suggested us to make the up arrow a way another way for the user to jump so that the user can have more option to choose from. Another takeaway from the expo was that we need to add an instruction scene. We realized that telling other students how to play the game used more time than needed.

Moreover we should fix our gif because it seem to be kind of blurry [Link to our presentation slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18cxWqP1cokwUJIaiEXNiO7qoK497ZI2w6uPl_6NhVuo/edit#slide=id.g24390b4a273_0_10135)
