Expo elevator pitch
One takeaway from the expo was that a judge suggested we make the up arrow another way for the user to jump so that the user can have more options to choose from. Another takeaway from the expo was that we need to add an instruction scene. We realized that telling other students how to play the game used more time than needed. Link to my elevator pitch
In-class presentation
One major takeaway from in-class presentation was that we should slow down on our presentation when giving a demo of our game so that the audience can clearly see and know how our game works. Moreover we should fix our gif because it seem to be kind of blurry Link to our presentation slide
