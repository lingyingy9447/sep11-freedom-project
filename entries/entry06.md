# Entry 6
##### 6/5/23
### Expo elevator pitch
One takeaway from the expo was that a judge suggested we make the up arrow another way for the user to jump so that the user can have more options to choose from. Another takeaway from the expo was that we need to add an instruction scene. We realized that telling other students how to play the game used more time than needed. However, we are super proud by our work and how many students enjoyed our game. [Link to our elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vIZ7mB2GwawjiH-ygJTlsPSdjDVUAj3yN2mG1XI__yE/edit)

### In-class presentation
One major takeaway from in-class presentation was that we should slow down on our presentation when giving a demo of our game so that the audience can clearly see and know how our game works. Moreover we should fix our gif because it seems to be kind of blurry. Overall, we think that we did great on the presentation and that we spoke loud enough for everyone to hear us.

### Engineering and Design Process and SKills 
We are currently on **communicating the result** of the engineering design process (EDP). Through this week we were showing off our freedom project to the class and to other students in the school. We have gotten a lot of positive and helpful feedback on how to improve our project and what we did well on. The next step will still be the same because we will continue to present our project to people outside of school and colleges. During this process I developed the skill sets of **communication** and **collaboration**. The past few weeks my partner and I improved a lot on collaboration because we had to break down what slides we will be doing for the presentation and what we will say in the expo. It was really a collaboration thing. We also improved our communication skills because not only did we communicate with each other, we also worked to communicate to a wider range of the community. We had to speak to other students about our process and how we manage to overcome the challenges we faced while making the game.
