### Context 
The past few weeks my partner and I have started working toward our MVP goal for the freedom project while still learning about [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) using its documentation.

#### 2/13/23
* We worked on the [MVP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D9-ubC12_LUe9OeI-zrdFbH8p41EEv0Z9Q9h3Sa9F5I/edit) Plan 
* We decided on what was important for our freedom project to work, the minimun viable product 
* We also planed our work flow out and tried our best to follow the plan.

``` js

var music = play("name"){
