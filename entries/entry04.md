# Entry 4 Working toward our MVP goals
##### 3/13/20

### Content
The past few weeks my partner and I have started working toward our MVP goal for the freedom project while still learning about [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) using its documentation.

#### 2/13/23
* We worked on the [MVP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D9-ubC12_LUe9OeI-zrdFbH8p41EEv0Z9Q9h3Sa9F5I/edit) Plan. While doing this, we decided on what was important for our freedom project to work, the minimum viable product. We also planned our work flow out and tried our best to follow the plan. 

#### 2/20/23
``` js 
loadSound("name", "link-to-the-sound) 
var music = play("name", {
  // any action you want the sound to do 
})
volume(number)
```
* The smaller the number is inside `volume()` the lower the volume is and vice versa
* `loadSound` is just like `loadSprite` but it is used to import sound into the system. 
#### 2/27/23
* During the mid-winter break my partner and I decided on what sprite we need and their looks 
Sprites we need : 
* Main Sprite (cat) 
* Coin (a squid and or an octopus) 
* A Door where the user can get to the next level 
* Various color of blocks 
* Enemy (a larger cat) 
#### 3/6/23 - 3/13/23
Between these days we worked on our sprites using [Pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/) 
* The blocks:

### Engineering Design Process and Skills 
I'm currently on **creating a prototype** of the **engineering design process** (EDP). Throughout this process, I continued to tinker with kaboom using the documentation and playground. Additionally, my partner and I worked toward our MVP plan by creating sprites that we would use for our platformer game. The next step for my would still be **Create a prototype** because I would still be progressing toward my MVP while learning more functions on Kaboom. Throughout this process, I developed the **skill** sets of **communication** and **how to learn**. During the past few weeks I had to communicate with my partner to decide on our MVP and what sprites we need for the game to run. We also had to learn to use a new [website](https://www.pixilart.com/) to make our sprite. It was somewhat challenging for us because we just got exposed to that website but we still managed to finished our sprites.
