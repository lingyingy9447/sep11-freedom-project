# Entry 1 : How I decided on my Java Script tool
##### 11/7/22

The past few weeks I have been tinkering with numerous tools in order to find the right tool that I will incorporate into my freedom project. My priority choice was making a 3D animation escape room game with [Threejs](https://threejs.org). However, as I tinkered with Threejs, I realized that Threejs is only for 3D animation and not a game engine. Therefore, I tinker with my second tool which is [Phaser](https://phaser.io/). I planned to use Phaser to make a platformer game. After spending a few hours tinkering with Phaser, I decided to change my tool again. Phaser is a game engine, however, I do not feel like phaser is the right tool for me because I don't really understand its documentation and there are rarely any youtube tutorials for Phaser game engine. Lastly, I decided to use [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) because there are a lot of different game examples on their page and I was able to find various youtube tutorials that thoroughly teach me about Kaboom. I was trying to tinker with Kaboom to see if it works for escape the room game. However, Kaboom is more for 2D games than 3D, so I decided to use Kaboom to create a platformer game. The platformer game will have different levels and the user's goal is to collect everything possible and escape from those enemies by jumping over it. I used this [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nucjefSr6I) to guide me through the process of learning Kaboom. I tinker on  [Replit](https://replit.com/@lingyingy9447/mario-kaboomjs#game.js) while following through the tutorial and altering some parts of it.
