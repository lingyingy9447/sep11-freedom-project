# Entry 3 Tinkering with Kaboom 
##### 2/6/23
### Content 
For the past few weeks, I have been tinkering with [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) using the documentation. I finished the [youtube tutorials](https://youtu.be/2nucjefSr6I) during the winter break as one of my goals. I started to add more levels to the Mario game that I was working on and learned more game objects, assests, components, and events.
