# Entry 2: Tinkering with Kaboom
##### 12/12/2022
### Context
For the past month, I have been tinkering with [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) using the documentation and [youtube tutorials](https://youtu.be/2nucjefSr6I). I tinker with Kaboom in two ways. The first way is done during class where my partner and I will explore the components, game objects, assets, and etc for Kaboom. The second way is done at home where I will follow and code along with the tutorial I found. [Link to where I have been tinkering with](https://replit.com/@lingyingy9447/mario-kaboomjs#game.js)
